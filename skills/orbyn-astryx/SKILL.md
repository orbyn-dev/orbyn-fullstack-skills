# Astryx

Follow the consuming project's instructions and requested scope; use the
[portable defaults](../orbyn-workflow/references/project-policy.md) only where guidance is missing.

Astryx is Meta's MIT-licensed design system: React 19 or later, styles authored with
StyleX and shipped as prebuilt CSS, themes as CSS custom properties, page templates,
150+ components and a CLI that prints its own documentation. [UI design](../orbyn-ui-design/SKILL.md)
still owns the product decisions; this skill owns how they are built in Astryx.

## Before you start

1. **Confirm it fits.** A project uses Astryx when its `package.json` lists an
   `@astryxdesign/*` package. Adopting it in a new or existing app is a stack choice:
   check React 19+, the styling already in use and the migration cost with
   [stack selection](../orbyn-stack-selection/SKILL.md), and get the user's decision.
2. **Find the project's CLI.** Use the project's installed invocation: its package
   script (`pnpm astryx`, `npm run astryx --`) or local binary. That version's
   answers match the installed components. With no installed CLI, read the
   [bundled docs](references/upstream/astryx-docs/docs/README.md) (CLI 0.7.12) and say
   which version they describe; do not fetch a different CLI just to look something up.

## Build a page

Follow Astryx's own order. Each step is a read-only CLI call until you write code:

1. `astryx build "<idea>"`: the closest page template (or the app shell), two
   alternatives, and the blocks and components for what it lacks.
2. `astryx template <name> <path>`: scaffold it, keep its frame and spacing, replace
   the content. This writes files; it is part of the change you were asked to make.
3. `astryx component <Name>`: props, examples and the import path for every component
   you use. Import each from its own entry.

Astryx's rules, which this library adopts for Astryx projects: start every page from
a template; no raw `div` layout where a component exists; no `style={{}}`; tokens,
never magic values; keep a native element only when its semantics are needed and
Astryx has none. `astryx search`, `astryx docs <topic>` and `astryx doctor` answer the
rest. For anything the designs and templates do not settle, get a design draft first,
as the [lead contract](../orbyn-workflow/references/lead-contract.md#get-a-design-draft-first) says.

## Theme it

A theme is token overrides, not a fork. Map the project's look, or the
[Orbyn house style](../orbyn-ui-design/references/house-style/README.md) when it has
none, into `defineTheme({extends: <built theme>, ...})`: colours, type, radius,
spacing and elevation to their token families, component changes through the
`components` field and `astryx theme targets`. Generate shades with the palette
command rather than by hand. Run `astryx theme build` for server-rendered apps and
again after every Astryx upgrade. Eject (`swizzle`) a component only when a theme
override cannot express the change, and say why.

Astryx owns light and dark: switch with its `Theme` component's `mode` (`light`, `dark`
or `system`), not with our `data-theme` attribute and script, and never both. Our
outcome rules still hold: no flash of the wrong theme and nothing restyling after
load, which in an Astryx app means wiring the built theme CSS, since a runtime theme's
component overrides flash on hydration.

## Where these rules override Astryx's setup

1. **Project agent files belong to the project.** `astryx init --features agents`
   writes a managed block into `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`. Run it only with the
   user's OK; it never replaces the project's own instructions, and in this library's
   workspace it is never run against the library's own `AGENTS.md`.
2. **No global install without asking.** A global CLI install writes a skill into
   your home folder and links it into agent folders such as `~/.claude/skills/astryx`.
   Ask before installing globally; `astryx init --user` writes that file and
   `astryx init --user --remove-agents` turns it off. Inside a project, its own docs
   come first. If that global `astryx` skill is also loaded, treat it as reference;
   this skill's authority rules govern.
3. **Packages are changes.** Adding `@astryxdesign/*`, StyleX or a theme package, or
   upgrading them (`astryx upgrade --from <version> --apply`), needs the user's scope.
4. **The hosted docs are optional.** Astryx's docs site serves an MCP endpoint. Adding
   that MCP server to a host is a configuration change: ask first.
5. **Our checks still apply.** Verify in a real render: light and dark, the widths in
   [design rules](../orbyn-ui-design/references/design-rules.md), and for a desktop app
   the built window's chrome. Review Astryx code with its rubric (`astryx docs
   is-my-code-good`), marking anything you could not see `not inspected`.

## Source and updates

The agent docs of [meta/astryx](https://github.com/meta/astryx/tree/c86484dc57847e7c4d1127810ff1422bc2174d4d/packages/cli/assets/docs)
are bundled unmodified at `c86484d` (CLI 0.7.12), MIT, with the license and a
`snapshot.json` of file hashes. They are `.mjs` modules the CLI prints; read their
`prose`, `list` and `code` entries. Refresh them with
[upstream review](../orbyn-upstream-review/SKILL.md) when Astryx releases, and prefer the
project's installed CLI over this copy whenever they differ.
